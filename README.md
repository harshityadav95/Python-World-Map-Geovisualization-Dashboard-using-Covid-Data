Python World Map Geovisualization Dashboard using Covid Data

Welcome!
Welcome to Python World Map Geovisualization Dashboard using Covid Data. This is a project-based course which should take approximately 1 hour to finish. Before diving into the project, please take a look at the course objectives and structure:

Course Objectives
In this course, we are going to focus on these learning objectives:

1. Access data via an API.

2. Data Preprocessing.

3.  Generate a choropleth map.

4. Generate circular markers.

5. Generate a heat map.

6. Convert Jupyter notebook to dashboard.

Course Structure
This course is divided into 3 parts:

Preliminary reading Material.
Python World Map Geovisualization Dashboard using Covid Data: This is the hands on project that we will work on in Rhyme.
Graded Quiz: This is the final assignment that you need to pass in order to finish the course successfully.
Project Structure
The hands on project on Python World Map Geovisualization Dashboard using Covid Data is divided into the following tasks:

Task 1:  Access data via an API.

Task 2: Data Preprocessing.

Task 3:  Generate a choropleth map.

Task 4: Generate circular markers.

Task 5: Generate a heat map.

Task 6: Convert Jupyter notebook to dashboard.


## Process

Convert a Jupyter Notebook into a Dashboard
Note: So that you don't have to enter your personal details into the VM, this section of the project is a set of written instructions which you can try out on your personal system.

To create a dashboard like the one I created in the video, follow these steps:

1) Make a copy of the notebook that you receive after completing this project. Rename it 'covidmap'. (Or any other short name)

2) Remove all Markdown cells. 


3) The only output that should be visible are the final choropleth map with markers and the final heatmap with markers. To prevent other outputs from being displayed, just add a semicolon at the end of the code and rerun the kernel.


4) To add a heading above the maps to indicate what they represent, just add a markdown cell above the cell containing the map output.


5) Save your notebook. Ensure that it is in the same directory as your jupyter lab installation.

6) Open the terminal and type in:  

jupyter nbconvert covidmap1.ipynb --no-input --no-prompt


Note: If you named the copy of the notebook something else, replace that name where I have used 'covidmap.ipynb'

7) You will now have a file named 'covidmap.html'
